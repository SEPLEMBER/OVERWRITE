Simple Text Crypt
=================

It's an Android app which encrypts plain texts using AES256 algorithm.

Why Another App?
---------------

Most of the text encryption apps I found has had access to the internet, and
I couldn't trust them!  Thus, I decided to write my own app.

Can You Trust it?
-----------------

This app is secure enough for i.e. sending messages to your friends or
encrypting your diaries. It uses
[AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
in ``CBC`` mode with ``PKCS5`` padding, which is very powerful encryption.

However, I'm not a security expert, so I don't recommend using this
app for serious data encryption.

Why Should You Encrypt?
----------------------

It's a big subject to discuss. I recommend reading these two articles:

1. [Why do you need PGP?](http://www.pgpi.org/doc/whypgp/en/)
In this article, Phil Zimmermann compare encryption of emails to putting
letters in an envelop: if you don't have anything to hide, why do you hide
your messages in envelops?

2. [Why we encrypt?](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/06/why_we_encrypt.html)
This article tells us that we should encrypt everything not just to protect our
privacy, but also to protect those activists which their lives are depend on
encryption.
