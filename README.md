ZER0LESS ðŸ˜„
While AI is busy generating secure code, one introverted developer sips tea in peace. Welcome to ZER0LESS, a secure text encryption app for Android, forked from the awesome SimpleTextCrypt by Aidin Gharibnavaz. This project brings modern encryption, multilingual support, and a sleek AMOLED theme to keep your secrets safe (or as safe as 2025 allows ðŸ˜‰).
Features

Secure Encryption: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation for robust text encryption.
Multilingual Interface: Supports Russian, English, Ukrainian, Japanese, Spanish, German, Italian, and French.
Theme Options: Light, Dark, and AMOLED themes for a comfortable user experience.
Lock Timeout: Configurable lock timeout to protect your data.
Secure Password Handling: Uses char[] for passwords to minimize memory leaks.

Cryptographic Parameters
ZER0LESS uses the following parameters for encryption (implemented in Crypter.java):

Cipher: AES-GCM with 256-bit keys (AES/GCM/NoPadding), ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
Salt: 32 bytes (256 bits) for strong key derivation with PBKDF2.
Initialization Vector (IV): 12 bytes (96 bits), standard for AES-GCM.
Authentication Tag: 128 bits for robust data integrity.
PBKDF2 Iterations: 75,000 with HmacSHA256 for secure key derivation.
Format: v1:[Base64(salt)]:[Base64(iv)]:[Base64(ciphertext)] for compatibility and extensibility.

These parameters provide a strong foundation for secure text encryption, suitable for most use cases in 2025.
Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ZER0LESS.git


Build with Gradle:
./gradlew build


Install the APK:
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk



Disclaimer: No System Is Safe
As MRX said in Who Am I (2014): "No System Is Safe." In the spirit of Zero Trust, we acknowledge that no encryption system is immune to risks. While ZER0LESS uses modern cryptographic standards (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2), users should remain vigilant, use strong passwords, and avoid sharing sensitive data on untrusted devices. That said, the algorithm is robust and reliable for 2025 standards, providing strong protection for your data.
